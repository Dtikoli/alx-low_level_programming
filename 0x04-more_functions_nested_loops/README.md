This repository holds some projects I worked on as an ALX student. 
The goal was to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.
It is related to gaining a better understanding of functions and loops.
The outline of the concepts are given below:
1.  nested loops and how to use them
2. functions and how to use functions
3. difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
4. a prototype
5. scope of variables
6. gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
7. header files and how to to use them with #include
